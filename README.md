A Visual Studio Code theme that personally allow me to focus more. Better suited for those who like to code late into the night or simply like dark themes. Color choices are personal and as v0.0.1 subject to change with use, experiences and suggestions. âœ¨

## Misc

This is my first time creating a theme, so if you see something wrong, please feel free to [file an issue](https://gitlab.com/mohammed.tantawy/ash-dark-theme-vs-code/-/issues)!

The reason why I choose to publish on GitLab is because the images won't render since the path still points to 'master' instead of 'main' since the change.

Settings used for font
```sh
"editor.fontFamily": "FiraCode-Retina",
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
```
